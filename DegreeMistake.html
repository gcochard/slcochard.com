Some little girls wore tutus and wanted to be ballerinas. I wanted to be the next J.K. Rowling (it seemed like the easiest way to get my Hogwarts letter at the time). </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">It never really occurred to me how I would make a career out of that. Nowadays it feels like being born with an affinity for language arts also means you were conjoined with an evil twin that keeps asking you, &ldquo;but what do you </span><span class="c0">do </span><span class="c1">with that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">According to a recent survey, that question may have an answer that surprises you. In a recent </span><span class="c6 c1"><a class="c8" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2Fid%2F100642178&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPFYvw6C1SW8Ws23oEMpx0yFd46Q">CNBC</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;article, a survey of CEOs by the Association of American Colleges and Universities said that 74 percent of them would recommend a 21st-century liberal education in order to create a more dynamic worker. Ninety-five percent said they look for college graduates who can think clearly and solve problems and translate their ideas with good oral and communication skills. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&quot;We want task-orientated people who have disciplines in critical thinking,&quot; stated Michael Fromm, CEO of Fromm Electric, an electrical manufacturing firm based in Reading, Pa in the article. &quot;If someone&#39;s studied literature, they know people and have insight into themselves and customers. I find people that have a liberal arts background have a broader view of the world and will go farther in business.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Why, thank you, Mr. Fromm. There is hope for those Liberal Arts majors that want to succeed in the business world. I&rsquo;d like to shake the hand of the CEOs surveyed and thank them for realizing Humanities majors can look good in suits too. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">We know computer and engineering majors usually result in the </span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2Fid%2F100777334&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2uAsyhZLyWCjQrD4kz0NbKnQ5xQ">highest paying</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;positions, but communication skills are in short supply in many of these graduates - and believe it or not, that can be a detrimental factor to the bottom line of many businesses. The article continues, &quot;In places like Google, they want people who are self-motivated and articulate and can think on their own. It&#39;s not enough just to have tech skills. Graduates have to do more.&quot; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The counterpoint to Humanities majors? They should do more, too. Just because Shakespeare didn&rsquo;t have a computer doesn&rsquo;t mean Liberal Arts buffs shouldn&rsquo;t try their hand at technology-forward projects (I&rsquo;m sure the Bard would have been an expert blogger). </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The solution? It sounds to me like the key to success is being well-rounded. The best possible candidate is a diverse one that can balance the arts and the sciences in harmony to highlight a unique set of skills. If you find yourself writing poems in binary code, you&rsquo;ve probably reinvented the wheel. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span></span></p></body></html>
