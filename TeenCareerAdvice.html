Remember the little blue-eyed bundle that spit up peas and giggled wildly when playing peek-a-boo? How did your toddler go from playing with toy cars to actually</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;driving</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a car? (And a little too fast, you might add). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before you wake up to discover the infant who depended on you to change their diapers is graduating from high school, you need to face the &ldquo;Pomp and Circumstance&rdquo; and get moving on their future and discuss a career path. That is, unless instead you&rsquo;d like to convert the basement into a &ldquo;den of parenting failure&rdquo; to shelter your 45-year-old son for the rest of his life? Probably not. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprise! The Most Important Factor is You</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The greatest influence on a teen&rsquo;s future career is the support they receive from their parents. The encouragement, guidance, and love you offer will carry them through their sea of choices and help discover the passion that leads to a successful career. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The easiest way to start encouraging your child? Ask them what they love to do. Open the avenue of communication so that your teen knows you are available to discuss their future and are willing to support their choices. As obvious as this seems, it may be helpful for your teen to hear confirmation of what they already know &ndash; they are loved and supported during a time of self-discovery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nurture Their Interests</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Once you have an idea of activities they enjoy, research ways to grow and refine their skills that aren&rsquo;t necessarily covered in school. Are they crazy for Twitter or other Social Media? Take a seminar on how Social Media applies in the modern workplace and can be used in a career. &nbsp;Are they a movie buff or live for music? &nbsp;Encourage them to start a blog where they review and discuss their favorites. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Many of the marketable computer, communications, and other skills coveted by employers may be foreign to your teen, so helping them to get informed and excited early on will put them ahead and help develop these important interests. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Change is a Constant </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Bureau of Labor Statistics finds that people have an average of about 14 jobs by the time they turn 40. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice for your teen to know they&rsquo;ll have a little variety in their professional life and won&rsquo;t be corned into one job forever? Teens are likely to look for a little adventure, so the possibility of living a well-rounded life would be appealing to hear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Of course your teen will change, evolve and transition on their road to discover their career, but you are the determining factor in helping them create a happy and healthy life full of professional promise. The best thing you can do for them? Start early and dive into career discovery together. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span></span></p></body></html>
