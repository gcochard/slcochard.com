Wire the home with speakers? Build a shed for more storage?</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re looking to increase the value of your home, chances are you&rsquo;re wrestling with many &ldquo;should we or shouldn&rsquo;t we&rdquo; kinds of questions. Before you invest in something that might not warrant the best return, consider these tips to ensure you&rsquo;re on the right track for improving your home in a way that will pay off for the long-term and keep your home competitive for future play in the market:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Open Up Your Floorplan</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Open floor plans are gaining in popularity because they create airy living spaces with natural light that allow families to collaborate and stay engaged without crowding each other. Instantly modernize the layout of your home by knocking down any walls that separate the kitchen from the main living area. If your home is older and segmented into smaller rooms or hallways, consider doing minor construction to utilize that space and instantly update your home&rsquo;s style.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Modernize the Kitchen &ndash;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Cook up some value by investing in the heart of the home: the kitchen. As a central place to congregate, the kitchen is an important room for many buyers. Ensure yours is functional and welcoming by purchasing new appliances and updating cabinets and countertops with better materials to appeal to buyers looking for a heart of the home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Go Green&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">&ndash; Energy efficient homes are increasingly in demand for upkeep of the outside and repaint the inside every few years to present well. Solar, anything that helps keep heat in during the colder months and out during the warmer months will help.&rdquo;more energy efficient. The changes can be small, such as adding storm doors or a ceiling fan in each room. Or they can be large, like double- or triple-paning your windows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Keep it Up &ndash;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Fix things that break. Paint things that fade. Replace things that need replacing. Simple general upkeep of your home and the features in it like electric, plumping and aesthetic will keep your home looking desirable for the long-term. Address issues as soon as they pop up to prevent worse ones in the future and make sure you home is up to snuff at all times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Know Your Market &ndash;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Stay informed about other homes selling in your neighborhood. Do the homes that tend to sell quickly and for above asking price have stunning gardens? Built in solar panels? Two-car garages? Notice patterns and evaluate what those homes have that yours doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p></body></html>
